Wannier procedure:

Two tracks:

A. Make abinitio bands:  (required to run this procedure to set win_min win_max froz_min froz_max)
   1. SCF (pw.x)
   2. BANDS (pw.x)
   3. bands plot (bands.x)

B. Wannierization
   1. SCF (pw.x)
   2. NSCF (pw.x) 
      - need to create new k grids in K_POINTS block
      - set nosym = .true.
   3. preprocess (wannier90.x -pp seedname)
      - if spin-polarized, set spin=up or spin=down
   4. PW2WAN (pw2wanner90.x)
   5. wannier90.x seedname



To check the quality of wannierization, compare ab initio bands vs. wannier bands
